# matplotlib_csv
Advanced Python - Matplotlib - using CSV files

this project is to teach students how to use CSV files in python
this project also teaches students how to visualize the data using matplotlib

The file is sitka_death_valley_comparison.py

I first opened the sitka file similar to previous iterations.

Then, I created variables for each of the pertinent headers.

I then created empty lists for the highs, lows, and dates

Lastly, I created a for loop to ignore missing data and append the pertinent data

I repeated all of these steps for Death Valley data

Then, I imported matplotlib and created subplots and a general title
